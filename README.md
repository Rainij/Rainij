# Hi I'm Reinhard ...

... a mathematician from Germany. After recieving my PhD in 2017 I went into software development working for the automotive industry.
My daily work involves programming in C++, Python, JavaScript/TypeScript and writing bash-scripts.

I have experience in inventing, tweaking and reverse engineering numerical algorithms.
The later being valuable for working on undocumented legacy code with nobody there to ask.
Moreover I have experience in finite-element-analysis, machine learning, and - by accident - web-frontend-development (with angular).

Currently I use my spare time to learn about the following topics:

- Functional Programming with a focus on Interactive Theorem Proving.
- AI / Machine Learning with a focus on theory and "Automated" Theorem Proving.
- WebAssembly with a focus on its design.

I am looking forward to work professionally on these topics in the future.

In case you wonder about my interest in interactive/automated theorem proving: I am an enthusiastic mathematician and I like problem solving.
Stating a new theorem and proving it by "bare hands" is one of the most enjoyable things for me.
Still, I think that finding and proving theorems with the help of computers will become the *default* way to do *serious* mathematical research in the future.
I think the only question is *when* this will happen. In years, decades, or yet a much farther away future?
Although, there are some impressive success-stories already, and the topic is not new, I don't believe that we are merely a few years away from that future.
On the other hand I *hope* it is in the decades-range, because I want to see it happen.
It would be nice to solve Riemann's Conjecture or the NP-Problem in that fashion.
Moreover, I suspect that technologies making this possible would mean a significant acceleration of progress in many areas of science and engineering.
Certainly this will have a huge impact on the industry sector.
