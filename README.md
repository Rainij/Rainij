# Hi I'm Reinhard ...

... a mathematician from Germany. I work for [ParityQC](https://parityqc.com/) as a
quantum compiler developer.

Previously I worked for the automotive industry (simulation data management) with five
years of experience. I recieved my PhD in mathematics (Tauberian theorems, decay of waves)
in 2017.

I mainly work with Python and Rust. Previously I also worked with C++ and TypeScript. I
have some superficial knowledge of Emacs Lisp, Standard ML, Lean, WebAssembly, and x86-64
Assembly.

I use my spare time to learn about selected topics in unsupervised machine learning
(reinforcement-learning, etc.). Moreover, I am interested in computer aided theorem
proving.
