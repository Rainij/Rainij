# Hi I'm Reinhard ...

... a mathematician from Germany. After recieving my PhD in 2017 I went into software development working for the automotive industry.
My daily work involves programming in C++, Python, JavaScript/TypeScript and writing bash-scripts.

I have experience in inventing, tweaking and reverse engineering numerical algorithms.
The later being valuable for working on undocumented legacy code with nobody there to ask.
Moreover I have experience in finite-element-analysis, machine learning, and web-frontend-development.

I use my spare time to learn about the following topics:

- Quantum Computation - I enjoy [solving the exercises](https://rainij.github.io/solutions-qcqi-nielsen-chuang/) in the well known book of Nielsen and Chuang.
- The Rust programming language.

Moreover, I am interested in AI, computer aided theorem proving, and design of programming languages. Currently I am a layman in these topics.
